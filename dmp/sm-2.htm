    <h1>Creating Facebook business page</h1>
    <p>As you already know - Facebook is well known social media network and it is extremely popular. In this HOT Session I will show you how to create a Facebook page. For that you must login to your Facebook profile on your computer. Please avoid Facebook applications to create Facebook page and use Facebook website.</p>
    
    <!-- Steps-->
        
    <step>1</step>
    <p>Login to your Facebook profile.</p>
    <p>Click on the right side of Facebook header as shown on the image below.</p>
    <div id="imgbase00" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd00" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/141.jpg">
    </div>
    <conti>Click on <span>create</span> page to create a business page.</conti>
    
    <step>2</step>
    <p>Choose a Classification for your business page.</p>
    <div id="imgbase01" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd01" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/142.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Each of these classifications provides more relevant fields for your desired Page. Select it according to the type of your business.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are running a local store, school, garage, clinic etc. Then click on Local Business or Place.</li>
        <li>If you are running a company with multiple locations. Then select Company, Organization, or Institution.</li>
        <li>If you are a brand and manufacture product or provide services then select Brand or Product.</li>
        <li>If you are an artist or politician then select Artist, Band, or Public Figure.</li>
        <li>If you are creating page for your short movie or games you have created, then select Entertainment and</li>
        <li>For your blog, personal website community etc. you can select Cause or Community.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are still confused, then select cause or community and later on you can switch the page type. You will learn more how to switch page type in Facebook from DM buddy.</p>
    <p>So select one of them to continue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Business or Place: Select sub category, enter the name of business and fill the address.</li>
        <li>For any other category: Select sub category and enter name. And</li>
        <li>For Cause or Community: Just enter name.</li>
    </ul>
    <conti>Then click on <span>Get Started</span> to continue.</conti>
    
    <step>3</step>
    <p>Complete Basic Information. Facebook should automatically walk you through the following four basic sections to complete the fundamental aspects of your Page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Finish "About" Section:</b> The "about" section will serve as the main 2-3 sentence description for your company. It will be on your main page, so make it descriptive but succinct. Be sure to include a link to your company website as well. Also ensure that this information differentiates your brand, making your page even more appealing to potential followers. This is also where you can select your unique domain (that, as mentioned above, can only be changed once). For example, the DM Buddy has Facebook Page URL facebook.com/AppDmBuddy.</li>
        <li><b>Upload Profile Picture:</b> Next you'll be asked to upload a picture. This will serve as the main visual icon of your page, appearing in search results and alongside any comments you publish. While any perfectly square image will work, the recommended size is 180 x 180 pixels.</li>
        <li><b>Add to Favorites:</b> Every individual Facebook user has a vertical navigation bar to the left of their News Feed. You can add your Business Page as a "Favorite" item here -- similar to bookmarking a web page in your web browser -- for easy access.</li>
        <li><b>Reach More People:</b> Facebook will prompt you to create an advertisement to draw attention to your Page. Whether employing paid tactics is a part of your strategy or not, I recommend avoiding starting any ads at this stage -- there's no compelling content on the Page yet that would convince them to ultimately "Like" your page.</li>
    </ul>
    <conti>Create your account - to create your business presence.</conti>
    
    <step>4</step>
    <p>The basic skeleton of your Business Page is now live. Facebook will ask if you'd like to "Like" your Page. Again, I recommend avoid doing so at the moment. This activity will appear in News Feeds of those you're connected to personally to on Facebook. Without any content on the Page, we want to save that organic Timeline story for when you're really ready for people to view the Page.</p>
    <div id="imgbase02" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd02" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/143.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>In the top – page navigation, you'll see a few option tabs. Let’s discuss this briefly.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Page:</b> Front page of your Facebook business page. This will be visible to the audience.</li>
        <li><b>Messages:</b> There you will see messages, which your visitors leave on your page.</li>
        <li><b>Notifications:</b> This section allows you to customize when and how you'd like to receive Page alerts. Set a frequency that fits your social media marketing schedule.</li>
        <li><b>Insights:</b> Shows your pages analysis and insights. It will help to understand and improve the Facebook business and improve your ROI (Return On Investment) on Facebook. We will cover this on preceding chapters.</li>
        <li><b>Publishing Tools:</b> Helps you to manage and publish posts on your page.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Setting Option</h2>
    <p>You should now focus on most the important option that is setting. It is on right top of page navigation. Setting option will help you to manage and control your Facebook business page. You can change the information, set your privacy, change your address, and manage restrictions, cross posting settings and more. Create your page and explore these options.</p>
