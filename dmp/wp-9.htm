    <h1>Adding new user to WordPress website</h1>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Before starting, I recommend you to open your WordPress website. And visit wp-admin “dashboard of your WordPress website”. Login to your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.</p>
    
    <!-- Steps-->
    
    <div class="space"></div>
    <step>1</step>
    <p>To add a new user to your WordPress site, log in to your WordPress site and click to expand the Users menu.</p>
    <conti>Click the Add New link located in the Users menu.</conti>
    
    <step>2</step>
    <conti>Enter the username, email address, first name, last name, website, and password for the user.</conti>
    
    <step>3</step>
    <p>If this user is brand new, it’s a good idea to select to send this password to the new user by email.</p>
    
    <step>4</step>
    <p>Next, select the subscriber role for the user.</p>
    <note>To see a basic overview of WordPress user roles, click the Help tab at the top of the screen. Here you’ll see details for how user roles relate to site privileges, so you’ll be able to decide which level of access to grant to your new user.</note>
