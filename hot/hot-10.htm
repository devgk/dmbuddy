    <p>Before starting, I recommend you to open your WordPress website. And visit wp-admin “dashboard of your WordPress website”. Login to your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.</p>

    <p>Open or create a new page or post in your WordPress dashboard where you would like to insert image.</p>
    <conti>Place your cursor inside the post editor. You can also position your cursor between the content to add media in between two paragraph.</conti>
    
    <step>2</step>

    <step>3</step>
    <conti>Your WordPress site uses a media library to store all of your media like images and videos. From this box, you can choose to either upload a new file or use an existing file in from the media library. To upload an image, click the <span>Select files</span> button. Find the image you’d like to use and click open.</conti>

    <p>Now that your image has been uploaded, you’ll see it has been added to the media library. On the right side of this box, you’ll see the attachment details for this page. Here you can change the Title, Caption, Alt text and Description. You can also choose the alignment of the image (such as center, left or right), where the inserted image should link to, the actual URL of the image and the size of the image.</p>
