    <h1>Creating WordPress Page and Post</h1>
    <p>A Website is not possible with any web page. WordPress simplified the process of creating a web page using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. Web pages in WordPress are termed as Page and Post. Both are technically same - just defer in functionalities. Follow these steps to create your first page and post.</p>

    <h1>Creating WordPress Page</h1>
    <p>Before starting, I recommend you to open your WordPress website. And visit wp-admin “dashboard of your WordPress website”. Login to your WordPress dashboard to access admin panel.</p>
        
    <step>1</step>
    <p>To get started adding a new page to your WordPress site, find the Pages menu in the WordPress Dashboard Navigation menu. Click Add new.</p>

    </div>
    
    <step>2</step>
    <h2>Create Page</h2>
    <div id="imgbase01" class="noimgbase">
        <img onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd01" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/162.jpg">
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the title of the page, like About, Contact etc.</li>
        <li>Next is the content formatting section or post editor. This is where you’ll actually type the content of your post or page.<br>
        If you look on the right side of the box, you’ll see two tabs. There are two modes of editing posts - Visual and Text modes.
        </li>
        <note><b>Visual Tab:</b> The Visual tab will bring up the visual WYSIWYG editor. Here you’ll see a formatting toolbar with lots of options for formatting your content. If you’re familiar with Microsoft Word or any other word-processing software, most of these icons should look familiar.</note>
        <note><b>Text Tab:</b> If you click the Text tab, this will reveal a plain-text HTML version of the post editor. This version of the post editor is for editing the HTML code of your post. For most users, the Visual editor is the easiest way to write posts.</note>
        <li>Preview the page to see how it will look.<br>
        <div class="space"></div>
        Use Publish section of the page when you’re ready to publish, you can either publish immediately, or save you page as a draft, or schedule the page to be published later.
        </li>
        <li>After publishing you can visit this page of your website with the permalink (URL of this page).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Creating WordPress Post</h1>
    <p>Creating post in WordPress is similar to creating pages that you have read before.</p>
        
    <step>1</step>
    <p>To get started adding a new post to your WordPress site, find the Post menu in the WordPress Dashboard Navigation menu. Click Add new.</p>
    <div id="imgbase02" class="noimgbase">
        <img onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd02" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/164.jpg">
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to Posts » All Posts and delete the default “Hello world” post. To delete click on “Bin”.</li>
        <li>Similarly, go to Pages » All Pages and delete the default “Sample Page”.</li>
        <li>And finally, click on “Comments” and delete the default comment.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    
     <step>2</step>
    <h2>Create Post</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the title of the post<br>
        <div class="space"></div>
        Post is like an article, update, or news. So its title should be like the heading of an article.
        </li>
        <li>Next is to add content as you did for the page.</li>
        <li>In post you will find two new options. That is categories and tags which you can assign it to your WordPress post. I will cover these two topics in more detail later.</li>
        <li>Publish it similarly as you did before.</li>
    </ul>
