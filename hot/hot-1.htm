    <h1>Getting domain name and web hosting</h1>
    <h2>Getting Domain Name</h2>
    <p>As you already know, registering your domain name is the first step in establishing your online presence and reaching visitors. Registering a domain name means registering the name you want with an organisation called ICANN through a domain name registrar.</p>
    <p>To get a domain name you have to pay a registration fee to domain name registrar. That will give you the right to the domain name for a year, and you will have to renew it annually for (usually) the same amount per annum. Purchasing a name is a relatively simple process (although finding one that isn't already taken can be a challenge), but there are many factors that you should consider. Since your domain name is, in effect, the name of your website, you want to make sure you get a good one.</p>
    <p>Characteristics of good domain name:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple and understandable for your target audience</li>
        <li>Easy to remember</li>
        <li>Can be on the name of your business or keywords of your product, services or blog</li>
        <li>Avoid hypes and dash [Remember: domain name never accepts space between the characters]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Domain names disappear extremely fast. Many people claim that all the good domain names are gone. It is probably true that most good domain names that are descriptive of products and services have been taken. If you want a domain name for your site, I suggest you act now, or face the anguish of having lost that name later.</p>
    <p>Suggestion: Think of a few good domain names that you'd like to use. Don’t just think one domain name. It might already be taken. So think multiple domain names.</p>
    <p>Below I have listed the few domain name registrars I prefer. You can also find and chose the domain name registrar of your choice.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>One.com</li>
        <li>Bigrock</li>
        <li>HostGator</li>
        <li>Bluehost</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Steps-->
    
    <h2>Getting domain name and web hosting with One.com</h2>
        
    <step>1</step>
    <p>Earn 5 USD. Click on the below link to visit one.com and buy domain name and hosting for your business. By clicking the below link you will also earn 5 USD.</p>
    <a class="elink" href="http://one.me/enapdxpo" target="_blank">One.com</a>
    
    <step>2</step>
    <p>Select the plan which suits you the best. Note I recommend you to go for the professional plan, so that you can smoothly run WordPress on your server. Business plan is the best, if you have capital then go for it.</p>
    <div id="imgbase00" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd00" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/111.png">
    </div>
    <conti>Select your plan and click on the <span>Select</span> button to continue.</conti>
    <p>Starter plan can run WordPress, you can purchase that, but you may face performance issue when your number of visitors increases. Thereby you have to upgrade to higher plan in future.</p>
    
    <step>3</step>
    <p>Enter the name of your domain that you want to purchase – in the input field below “Select domain”.</p>
    <div id="imgbase01" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd01" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/112.png">
    </div>
    <p>You will get the suggestions by one.com. Click on the domain name which is available.</p>
    <div id="imgbase02" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd02" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/113.png">
    </div>
    <p>Do not purchase domain name which is taken, unless it belongs to you and registered by you. In that case you need to transfer your domain name from other registrar to one.com in order to use one.com Web Server.</p>
    <conti>Click on <span>Domain Name</span> you want to buy</conti>
    
    <step>4</step>
    <p>Check your order. Here you can add additional domains or remove the selected one. Fill customer information and select customer type as a private customer, unless you are an employee of any company.</p>
    <div id="imgbase03" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd03" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/114.jpg">
    </div>
    <conti>Click on <span>Next</span></conti>
    
    <step>5</step>
    <div id="imgbase04" class="noimgbase">
        <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" id="imghd04" class="noimghd" src="/hot/images/115.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Next you have to fill complete information. You can also add or remove extra features to your subscription. You must consider purchasing the features which I have recommended below.</p>
