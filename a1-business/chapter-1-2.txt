    <h1>Understanding Digital Marketing</h1>
    <p>In topic you will understand marketing and its components, what digital marketing is and how it can help you in your business. You can go through this topic once to understand the basics or you can skip it, if you already aware of digital marketing.</p>
    <h2>What is marketing?</h2>
    <p>Marketing is an essential part of any business. <hi>Marketing is the science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit.</hi> In simple words, we can elaborate marketing into three Components.
    </p>
    <ol style="text-align: justify;">
    <li><b>Generating Awareness:</b> Here I am talking about the consumer awareness. Business owners increase consumer awareness by employing a wide range of marketing techniques. The main reason of creating consumer awareness is <hi>to make consumers aware of particular products and services.</hi> It’s basically a passive marketing technique, where business and companies teach consumers – how to use particular product or services, how it can simply their lives etc. Companies which produces high-quality products and provides top-notch customer service, must create public awareness of these values through commercials, billboards or digital marketing campaigns.</li>
    <li><b>Creating Need:</b> If a business owner has successfully created an awareness, then the next step will be <hi>creating the need of that particular product or services in the customers mind.</hi> If someone don’t need that particular product or services, he or she won’t buy it. Don’t get confused with want. Wants are a step ahead of needs and are largely dependent on the needs of customers themselves. Customer wants particular products and services only when they are aware of particular product and services and they really need it. Creating wants is a complex procedure and depends upon the many factors. Many times it’s not in the controls of even the most expert marketing professionals.</li>
    <li><b>Satisfying Demand:</b> Generating awareness and creating need is an essential part of any marketing campaign. But it’s not just enough. To earn profit in order to run and sustain the business, we need to satisfy the demands. Satisfying the demands means <hi>identifying the potential customer (consumers who wants particular product or services) and fulfilling the demand at a profit.</hi> Big brands, companies and business often releases multiple types of discounts, offers, sales etc. to satisfy the demands.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What is digital marketing?</h2>
    <img onload="removeLoading()" src="images/112.jpg">
    <p>Doing marketing through internet on a digital platform (such as, computer, laptop, tablet, smartphones, mobile etc.) is digital marketing. Marketing also means promotion. So we can also say, Digital marketing is promotion of any company or business on the worldwide network of internet.</p>
    <p><b>In Technical Terms:</b> <hi>Digital marketing is a wide term used for the targetable, measurable, and interactive marketing process of products or services using digital technologies over a global network of internet, to reach the widest majority of audiences.</hi></p>
    <p><b>Don’t get confused!</b> Digital marketing is known by many names, such as, Internet Marketing, Online Marketing, Digital Promotion, Internet Promotion, Online Promotion etc. Further you will learn more technical terms along with this course. You can use DM Reference anytime to revise this term.</p>
    <h2>How it is different than traditional marketing?</h2>
    <p>Traditional marketing refers to any type of promotion, advertising or campaign that has been in use by companies for years, and that has a proven success rate. Methods of traditional marketing can include print advertisements, such as newsletters, billboards, flyers, newspaper print ads etc. As we are approaching towards the future, our marketing and promotion strategies are evolving over the time. We are now moving from old traditional marketing towards digital marketing.</p>
    <p>Digital Marketing and traditional marketing are both absolute form of marketing. <hi>The difference between traditional and digital marketing, lies on their strategies, process and platform.</hi></p>

    Bob can we combine traditional marketing with digital marketing?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Yes I think so. Kevin please explain!
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Yes of course! Stuart we can use traditional marketing and digital marketing at a same time. Bob is right. And it’s always a good idea to use both at a same time. It allows a business to reach to its potential customers from every possible medium.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/stuart.png"/><nm>

    </nm><span>
    So it is compulsory for a business to do both digital marketing and traditional marketing together.
    </span></p>

    Nothing is compulsory, it’s just recommended. According to your business model and investment capacity. As I think you already knows how costly traditional marketing is. It requires big investments when it comes to put your ads on newspaper, television etc. Most of the small business and startups, just can’t afford it.
    </span></p>

    </nm><span>
    Oh, I see. Bob I think Kevin wants to say digital marketing is cheaper. What do you think bob?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Of course Stuart. Kevin please explain him.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Comparatively Bob is right. Digital marketing is cheaper than traditional marketing. I will tell you in next topic. Just remember that, there are few digital marketing techniques that requires ZERO investment.
