    <h1>Different approaches of digital marketing</h1>
    <p>Till now, I can assume you had a basic idea of Digital Marketing such as what it is and its importance. As you are fully aware of its importance, then let’s discuss different approaches of digital marketing. Here I will elaborate different tactics of Digital Marketing, which you can implement on your business.</p>
    <p>There are two different types of digital marketing approach. Those are organic and in-organic approach. In this topic we will discuss these in details.
    </p>
    <h2>What is organic digital marketing approach?</h2>
    <p>It is the natural and free digital marketing approach. It requires proper skills, not direct investment for digital promotion. It is very common approach, as it is mostly free. Almost all companies first go with organic promotion. The only drawback with this digital marketing approach is, it has huge competition. It includes SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p>
    <p>Search Engine Optimization: It is a process of improving your website ranking on Google, when somebody search something related to your business. It’s not as simple as it sounds. But don’t worry, I will explain this SEO in complete detail.</p>
    <h2>What is in-organic digital marketing approach?</h2>
    <p>It is basically paid digital marketing approach. It requires both, proper skills and investment, for digital promotion. Most of the companies and business go with in-organic digital marketing, rather than just relying on organic approach. As it gives better result even in high competitive market. The only drawback is, there is no free alternative. It includes</p>
    <p>Online Advertisements: It is exactly similar to as it sounds. Online advertisement means running promotional advertisements on internet. It is the most powerful approach to reach to your right audience at a right time.</p>
    <p>Online Affiliate Marketing: If you are a manufacturer, or service provider, then you can provide affiliate to other digital marketers. For that you can create a system, from where they can join with your business and carry forward your marketing on their own channels. In return, as most of the business do, you can award them with a commission or gift. It’s up to you. Online affiliate marketing can save your resources and capital that you need to invest in order to run your own digital marketing campaigns.</p>
    <h2>Other digital marketing approach</h2>
    <p>It’s basically a mixture of organic and in-organic digital marketing approach. They provide both free and paid marketing plans to their users. It includes</p>
    <ol>
    <li><b>Social Media Promotion:</b> APromoting your business or brand in social media channels such as, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Social media promotion is a combination of SMO and SMM. Thus they provide us both free (SMO) and paid (SMM) options for business promotion.</li>
        <ul>
        <li><b>SMO:</b> In social networks, we can improve, enhance and optimize our presence in order to promote a business or brand. We can create attractive posts, join groups, create events and more to increase engagements. For that we don't need to pay anything and we call this SMO (Social Media Optimization).</li>
        <li><b>SMM:</b> We just can't rely on social media optimization strategies to promote of business. In order to generate business effectively we should go with SMM (Social Media Marketing). SMM is a practice of running advertisements on social media networks.</li>

    Yes Bob, of course you can do that. Most of the startups, do the same. But there is one thing you should know.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    bob
    </nm><span>
    What?
    </span></p>

    Not all business are same. If you are running a business, where you target your most of the audience through internet. Then I suggest you to go with in-organic approach too along with organic approach. It because organic approach, can some time takes time. But in-organic approach yields result instantaneously.

    DSo if your business relies completely on internet, then you may not able to make profit, only by following organic approach. Unless you are a brilliant digital marketer.
