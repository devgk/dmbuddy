    <h1>WordPress important terms</h1>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>There are few important terms of WordPress you should know before proceeding ahead.</p>
    <h2>1. Permalink</h2>
    <p>Permalinks are the permanent URLs to your individual posts, pages, as well as categories and other lists of weblog postings. In simple words - <hi>The URLs of the content you publish on your WordPress website are known as permalinks</hi>.</p>
    <p>A permalink is what another web-logger will use to link to your article (or section), or how you might send a link to your story in an e-mail message. The URL to each post should be permanent, and never change — hence permalink.</p>
    <p>Permalink can be found on Settings » Permalinks page in your WordPress admin area.</p>
    <h2>2. Theme</h2>
    <p>A WordPress theme is a template package used to customize the appearance of your WordPress website. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.</p>
    <p>Themes can be found under theme menu in your WordPress admin area.</p>
    <h2>3. Plugin</h2>
    <p>A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress.</p>
    <p>Plugins can be found under plugins menu in your WordPress admin area.</p>
    <h2>4. Widget</h2>
    <p>Widgets are tiny blocks of specific functionality that you can place in your WordPress sidebars (also known as widget-ready-areas). This is an easy way to add things like galleries, quotes, popular posts, Facebook like boxes, and other dynamic items on their WordPress site.</p>
    <p>Widgets can be found on Appearance » Widgets page in your WordPress admin area.</p>
    <h2>5. URL – Slug</h2>
    <p>A URL slug is the exact address of a specific page or post on your WordPress website. WordPress automatically assigns a URL slug for each new page, post etc. based on its title. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers and hyphens.</p>
