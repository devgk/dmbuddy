    <h1>Setting up Home Page and Blog Page</h1>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Home page is the first page of any website. It is also known as first interaction point, landing page or front page. By default WordPress puts your latest post in your home page. There by your home page gets every time you create a post. It’s good for the blog, news, social network and magazine type websites. But not for the business website.</p>
    <p>WordPress gives us both the options, to create a dynamic blog-like front page, or a static front page which is used to show customized content. In this topic you will learn to set static home page for your WordPress website.</p>
    <note>By default, WordPress uses the first option by showing your most recent posts on the front page.</note>
    <p>Some users prefer the second option. This feature is particularly useful for websites that want to keep a blog separate from other sections of their website or for users who want to showcase content other than blog posts on the front page of their website. It can also make the site feel less like a blog and more like a full feature website. As I already told, often this feature is used on business sites.</p>
    <h2>Create a page</h2>
    <p>Before you can set a custom static page for front page and custom blog page for you site, you have to create and publish the two sets of pages.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Custom page for Home Page:</b> This custom page should contain the content that you would like to display on the home page of your website. As you already know your home page is the landing page of your website. So put your most important information and USP on it. Your website title will automatically become the title of this page.</li>
        <li><b>Custom page for Blog Page:</b> This custom page shouldn’t contain any content. This page will automatically fetch your latest blog post and display them.  Just choose the appropriate title for your blog page something like “Your Business Blog”.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you don’t know how to create pages than this is the right time to learn it!</p>
