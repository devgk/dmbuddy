    <h1>Introduction to WordPress dashboard</h1>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>In this topic, I will give you a quick tour of the WordPress dashboard which provides access to all the site management tools for your website. The dashboard is the first screen you see when you successfully logged in to WordPress.</p>
    <p>The options you see on the dashboard will help you to manage, create and update your website without much of the technical knowledge. That’s why WordPress is perfect for the beginners.</p>
    <p>The WordPress dashboard is very powerful and confidential section of your website. It allows you to control all of the behind-the-scene details of managing your website. Don’t let it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
    <note>WordPress dashboard is also known as “wp-admin, WordPress backend or WordPress admin panel.</note>
    <p>Each screen in the wp-admin area contains three sections. A toolbar across the top of the page, the main navigation menu on the left-hand side and the main work area.</p>
    <p>The first time you log in to the WordPress dashboard. You will be greeted with the welcome module on the main work area that contains some links to help you get started. Including shortcuts to customize your website theme, begin creating content for your site, manage widgets and menus, enable comments or learn more. You can also dismiss this welcome module.</p>
    <p>At the top of the dashboard is the "toolbar" which contains links to the most commonly used administrative functions, including links to find more information about WordPress, view documentation and visit the support forums if you need help. Hovering over your site name reveals the link to visit a public view of your site and when you are logged in, the toolbar remains across the top of your WordPress website while you browse.</p>
    <note>Toolbar is only viewable to logged in users. So your actual website visitors won't see the toolbar in public view of yours site.</note>
    <note>"wp-admin" is known as the backend of your website and public view of your site is known as the frontend of your website.<br>
    Website Backend: "www.your-domain-name.com/wp-admin"<br>
    Website Frontend: "www.your-domain-name.com"</note>
    <p>This toolbar enables you to quickly customize your WordPress website, create new content at any time.</p>
    <p>From the frontend of the website, hovering over the site name can pull down links to return to the dashboard and other panels in wp-admin area.</p>
    <p>The toolbar also displays simple notifications if there are updates available for your site's theme or plugins, or if there is a new comment to moderate.</p>
    <p>The toolbar also gives you the quick links to create a new post, upload the media files, add a new page or create a new user.</p>
    <p>On the right-hand side of the toolbar, you will find links to edit your profile or log out. You can use the profile section to set up your personal preferences and update your personal information. To return to the dashboard at any time, simply click the on dashboard link at the top of the main navigation menu.</p>
    <p>On the left-hand side of the dashboard, there is the main navigation menu, which contains links to all the administrative screen in WordPress. Hovering over the menu item will display the submenu. Which contains additional options. We will discuss the navigation menu in proceeding topic.</p>
