    <h1>Different type of websites</h1>
    <p>Before deciding a website for your business. You must understand its type. Websites are categorized in multiple ways. These categories are based on the number of pages, design, and functionality.</p>
    <h2>Types of website based on pages</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>One page website:</b> <hi>It has single HTML web page</hi>.</li>
        <li><b>Multi-page website:</b> <hi>It contains the collection of web pages</hi>. Here user navigates from one web page to another using navigation menu.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <note>Number of pages in a website doesn't decide the amount of information.</note>
    <p>A one-page website and multi-page website can have the same amount of content irrespective of their number of pages. It’s all depends upon their design. Thus a number of pages are not the ideal criteria of website classification.</p>
    <h2>Types of website based on design</h2>
    <img draggable="false" onload="removeLoading()" src="images/122.gif"/>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Responsive website:</b>Based on the responsive bootstrap framework. <hi>A responsive website can fit on any device. Most of the modern websites are now responsive</hi>.</li>
        <li><b>Non-Responsive Website:</b> These websites are specially created for the specific website. These websites don’t change their dimension based on the devices.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <note>The actual classification is based on the features and functionality of the website.</note>
    <h2>Types of website based on features and functionality</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Static Website</b></li>
        <li><b>Dynamic Websites</b> and</li>
        <li><b>Portal websites</b></li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <example>Portfolio, catalog, showcase type websites etc.</example> 
    <definition>A static website is a collection of static web pages. Static web pages are often HTML documents stored as files. They contain only client-side processing languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS.</definition>
    <p>These websites are good only for representing the information that rarely changes. A static web page displays the same information for all users.</p>
    <h2>What is Dynamic Website?</h2>
    <p><hi>A dynamic website is a collection dynamic web pages</hi>. These are modern websites and it can ask and store information from users. It has modern functions such as – dynamic search, live chat, comments, reviews, feedbacks and more.</p>
    <example>All modern interactive websites such as news websites, gaming websites, blogs etc.</example>
    <definition>A dynamic website is a collection of dynamic web frame. Dynamic web frame is a skeleton of a dynamic website and does not contains any information. Dynamic website creates web page based on dynamic web frame by fetching data from the database using server-side processing languages such as PHP.</definition>
    <h2>What is Portal Website?</h2>
    <p>A portal website is an advanced version of a dynamic website. <hi>It contains user specific dynamic web pages</hi>. It has all the functions of the dynamic website. These websites are like a portal for their clients and registered users to explore their private data.</p>
    <example>E-Commerce website such as amazon, banking website etc.</example>
    <definition>A portal website is same as dynamic website. Additionally, it uses the database to store user information and provide automatic real-time user authentication and registration.</definition>
    <h2>Which website to select?</h2>
    <p>For a normal user, all websites are same. So just select the websites according to your need and budget. If you want to sell anything or to provide services online, then chose the portal website. A simple business can go for a dynamic website. There is no specific reason to select static website. Business selects static website, as they are more secure and cheaper than the dynamic website.</p>
