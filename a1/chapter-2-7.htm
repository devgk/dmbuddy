    <h1>Introduction to WordPress</h1>
    <p>In this topic, I will introduce WordPress. It is the most powerful content management system. It powers 27% of the internet.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to WordPress</h2>
    <p><hi>WordPress is completely free software which is used to develop dynamic websites</hi>. WordPress is very flexible and robust. Everyone from web developers to average computer users is using it to develop beautiful websites. It is completely customizable and can be used for almost anything.</p>
    <p>WordPress is basically a blogging software. A blog is a type of website or part of a website that is maintained on a regular basis by its owner. The blog is used as a news board with entries regarding updates, commentary, reviews, opinions, and other media such as video. The term blog is actually short for "web log" but can also be used as a verb.</p>
    <p>WordPress is completely free. There is no trial or premium. It is an open source software. It relies on the community of developers.</p>
    <p>WordPress has two websites “wordpress.org” and “wordpress.com”.</p>
    <h2>wordpress.org</h2>
    <p>You can download WordPress software free of cost for installation on your web hosting server from wordpress.org.</p>
    <note>wordpress.org is a site where you can download and install a software script called WordPress.</note>
    <h2>wordpress.com</h2>
    <p>“wordpress.com” provides you the WordPress hosted platform to develop a website. Wordpress.com provides hosting and ready to use installed WordPress software. It lets you get started with a new and free WordPress-based blog in seconds.</p>
    <note>wordpress.com provides a very simple and ready to use platform for website development. With wordpress.com you do not need to go with WordPress software installation. You just need to start developing your website.</note>
    <h2>Types of WordPress websites</h2>
    <p>WordPress seems little complex. But believe me, it is very simple. Let’s get into detail. There are two types of WordPress website you can create.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>“wordpress.com” hosted website:</b> This website can be created on wordpress.com.</li>
        <li><b>Hosted WordPress website:</b> This website can be created using WordPress software hosted on your web hosting server.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <h2>What's the difference between Installing WordPress and wordpress.com</h2>
    <p>You can set up your website at “wordpress.com” and take your business online instantly. Creating website with “wordpress.com” is different than installing WordPress software on your server. “wordpress.com “stores all your files on their server and you need to get an account with them to set it up.</p>
    <p>But, when you install WordPress on your server, you are bypassing wordpress.com and all storing your website data privately. This allows you to manage your WordPress website, without any limitation. This way you can unleash the full power of WordPress.</p>
    <h2>Comparison between WordPress.com and WordPress.org</h2>

    Can I first start with free wordpress.com hosted website and then move to hosted WordPress website.
    </span></p>

    That might not be the good idea. “wordpress.com” is very limited and you might not able to develop the website for your business according to the way you want. Plus it’s difficult to move your website from wordpress.com to self-hosted WordPress website.

    Kevin, there is any way to create a free hosted WordPress website?
    </span></p>

    Yes for testing purpose you can use Hostinger, 24x7zilla etc. They provide everything for free, including free domain name, hosting server and WordPress installation tool. But, these websites are not reliable for the business. You can learn more at “Webmasters Knowledge Hub”.

    It’s the website where webmasters can enhance their knowledge. Go and find it on Google.
