    <h1>Different approaches of digital marketing</h1>
    <img onload="removeLoading()" src="images/114.jpg"/>
    <p>Till now, I can assume you got the basic idea of Digital Marketing such as what it is and its importance. Now let’s discuss different approaches to digital marketing. Here I will elaborate different tactics of Digital Marketing, which you can implement it on your business.</p>
    <p><hi>There are two different types of digital marketing approach</hi>. Organic and inorganic approach. Let’s discuss this in detail.</p>
    <h2>What is organic digital marketing approach?</h2>
    <p>Organic means natural. As the name suggest, it is a kind of free digital marketing approach. It requires proper skills, not a direct investment for digital promotion. It is the very common approach and almost all companies first go for organic promotion. The only drawback with organic approach is, it has huge competition.</p>
    <p>Organic digital marketing includes SEO (Search Engine Optimization), SMO (Social Media Optimization) and more.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>SEO - Search Engine Optimization:</b> <hi>It is a process of improving your website ranking on search engines such as Google without paying anything</hi>. SEO is completely free.</li>
        <li><b>SMO – Social Media Optimization:</b> <hi>Promoting, optimizing, improving and enhancing your business presence in social media networks without running advertisements, is known as SMO – Social Media Optimization</hi>. SMO is completely free.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <h2>What is inorganic digital marketing approach?</h2>
    <p>It is basically <hi>paid digital marketing approach. Such as running online advertisements</hi>. It requires proper skills and capital investment. Most of the companies and business go with inorganic digital marketing, rather than just relying on organic approach. As it gives better result even in the high competitive market. The only drawback is, there is no free alternative.-</p>
    <p>Inorganic digital marketing includes online advertisements, affiliate marketing and more.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Online Advertisements:</b> It is exactly similar to as it sounds. <hi>Online advertisement means running promotional advertisements on the internet</hi>. You have seen ads on Television (T.V.). Running ads on T.V. is a part of traditional marketing, but running ads on the internet such as on YouTube is a part of digital marketing. It is the most powerful and effective strategy of internet marketing. It allows reaching to your potential audience at a right time.</li>
        <li><b>Mobile Marketing:</b> <hi>Running advertisements on mobile devices</hi>.</li>
        <li><b>SMM – Social Media Marketing:</b> <hi>It is a practice of running advertisements on social media networks</hi>. We just can't rely on social media optimization strategies to promote your business. It is time taking and results are unpredictable. In order to generate business effectively, webmasters combine SMM (Social Media Marketing) with SMO.</li>
        <li><b>Online Affiliate Marketing:</b> If you are a manufacturer or service provider, then you can provide affiliate to other digital marketers. For that, you can create a system. Through that digital marketers and bloggers can join with your business and carry forward your marketing on their own channels. In return, as most of the business do, you can award them with a commission or gift. It’s up to you. Online affiliate marketing can save your resources and capital that you need to invest in order to run your own digital marketing campaigns.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>The list isn’t over – There are other approaches to digital marketing. You will learn those, as you proceed with this course.</p>
    <h2>Mixed digital marketing approaches</h2>
    <p>These are basically a mixture of organic and inorganic digital marketing approach. They provide both free and paid marketing plans to their users. It includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Email Marketing:</b> <hi>It is a practice of generating business through promotional emails</hi>. Businesses send promotional email to their potential customers in order to generate business. For that, they use email marketing tools. These tools offer both free and paid plans. Free plans include a limited number of emails and subscribers per month. While paid plans comparatively increase this limit. Later, I will discuss this in detail.</li>
        <li><b>Classifieds and Business Listings:</b> There are businesses, which helps other small business to reach out to a large number of audience. They provide a platform to small business in order to sell and promote their product and services. Their business model offers both free and paid plans. Will discuss this later.</li>
    </ol>

    Kevin can I start my business, and promote it using an organic approach. And once I make some profit, I will start inorganic promotion.
    </span></p>

    Yes Bob, of course, you can do that. Most of the startups, do the same. But there is one thing you should know.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    bob
    </nm><span>
    What?
    </span></p>

    </nm><span>
    Not all business are same. If you are running a business, where you have to target most of your audience through the internet. Then I suggest you go with inorganic approach along with organic approach. It because organic approach will take time. But inorganic approach yields result instantly.
    </span></p>

    </nm><span>
    So if your business relies completely on the internet, then you may not be able to make a significant profit by only following the organic approach. Unless you are a brilliant digital marketer. So there is no point of putting your business at risk.
