For that, they run digital marketing campaigns on social media networks, famous websites, blogs, gaming and entertainment platforms etc. Today many businesses are implementing digital marketing strategies to target online users and to turn them into their client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to affordable and wider connectivity of the internet. There is an exponential rise in the number of internet users. So, internet is the easiest way to reach to the maximum number of audience.</p>

Among them, digital marketers can easily find potential customers for their business. They target them on their digital devices and promote their product and services according to their preferences and interest.</p>

Now to promote my business I can target online users who regularly visits fashion related websites. I can run advertisements over fashion related websites including social media networks such as Facebook to target them as they might be interested in my designer t-shirts.</p>

It helps to improve and optimize our digital marketing campaign accordingly.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Interaction:</b> One of the reasons why digital marketing is taking over traditional marketing channels is the ability of web marketing platforms to interact. Such as websites, mobile applications etc. Where business can<span style="background-color: #f9e6a5;"> interact with targeted audiences in real time</span>. Engagement in any form is what your customers expect to receive when interacting with your brand or business.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Remarketing:</b> Remarketing reduces the risk of losing a customer. We will discuss this in details later.
