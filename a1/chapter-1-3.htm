    <li><b>Cost-Effective:</b> As I said before, digital marketing is cost effective. Most of its <hi>strategies are free or require comparatively low investments</hi>. Running advertisements on digital media channels is significantly cheaper than running advertisements on traditional marketing channels such as TV, Newspaper etc.<br>
    Small businesses have very little resources and even capitalization.  For them, digital marketing is the best and most cost-effective marketing channel that delivers results in today’s market.</li>
    <li><b>Effective Measuring:</b> Measuring marketing objectives and efforts, on traditional marketing channels is really a difficult task and sometimes it's impossible.

It allows to effectively manage and improve our campaigns in order to generate more business. Measuring the effectiveness of digital campaigns is an integral part of engaging, exciting and efficient marketing.</li>
    <li><b>Better Targeting:</b> There are no other marketing channels, which allows you to <hi>target your audience effectively</hi> than digital marketing. Identifying the potential customers and targeting them, can save a lot of marketing resources including time and money. It also helps to increase the chances of conversion. We can target audience based on their interest, locations, languages etc.</li>
    <li><b>Accurate Tracking:</b> Through digital marketing, it is possible to understand your audiences and customers before it actually becomes your client. <hi>We can effectively track the activity of your website’s visitor using digital marketing tools</hi>. They use digital devices, which we can easily track and monitor. It helps to improve and optimize our digital marketing campaign accordingly.</li>
    <li><b>Interaction:</b> One of the reasons why digital marketing is taking over traditional marketing channels is the <hi>ability of Internet marketing tools to interact with targeted audiences in real time</hi>.
