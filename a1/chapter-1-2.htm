    <h1>Understanding Digital Marketing</h1>
    <p>In this topic, you will understand the fundamentals of traditional marketing and digital marketing.</p>
    <h2>What is marketing?</h2>
    <p>Marketing is an essential part of any business. <hi>“Marketing is the science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit”</hi>. In simple words, we can elaborate marketing into three Components.</p>
    <h2>Components of marketing</h2>
    <ol style="text-align: justify;">
    <li><b>Generating Awareness:</b> Here I am talking about the consumer awareness. Business owners increase consumer awareness by employing a wide range of marketing techniques. The main reason of creating consumer awareness is <hi>to make consumers aware of a particular products or services</hi>. It’s basically a passive marketing technique, where business and companies teaches consumers – how they can use a particular product or services. Companies which produces high-quality products and provides top-notch customer service must create public awareness of these values through commercials, billboards or digital marketing campaigns.</li>
    <li><b>Creating Need:</b> If your audiences are already aware of a particular product or services. Then the next step will be <hi>creating the need for that particular product or services in the customer's mind</hi>. If someone doesn't need that particular product or services, he or she won’t buy it. Don’t get confused with want. Wants are a step ahead of needs and are largely dependent on the needs of customers themselves. The customer wants particular products and services only when they are aware of particular product and services and they really need it. Creating wants is a complex procedure and depends upon the many factors. Many times it’s not in the controls of even the most expert marketing professionals.</li>
    <li><b>Satisfying the Demand:</b> Generating awareness and creating a need is an essential part of any marketing campaign. But it’s not just enough. To earn a profit in order to run and sustain the business, you need to sell your product or services. Satisfying the demands means <hi>“identifying the potential customer (consumers who want a particular product or services) and fulfilling their demand at a profit”</hi>. Big brands, companies, and business often release multiple types of discounts, offers, sales etc. To satisfy the demands of their customer</li>
    </ol>

    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Yeah!

    Bob can we combine traditional marketing with digital marketing?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Yes! I think so. Kevin can you please explain!
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Yes of course! We can use traditional marketing and digital marketing at the same time. Bob is right. And it’s always a good idea to use both at the same time. It allows a business to reach to its potential customers from every possible medium.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/stuart.png"/><nm>
    stuart
    </nm><span>
    So it is compulsory for a business to do both digital marketing and traditional marketing together.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Nothing is compulsory, it’s just recommended. You should choose according to your business model and investment capacity. As I think you already know how costly traditional marketing is. It requires big investments when it comes to putting your ads on newspaper, television etc. Most of the small businesses and startups, just can’t afford it.
    </span></p>

    </nm><span>
    Oh, I see. Bob, I think Kevin wants to say digital marketing is cheaper. What do you think bob?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Of course Stuart. Kevin, please explain him.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Comparatively Bob is right. Digital marketing is cheaper than traditional marketing. We will learn this in next topic. Just remember that there are few digital marketing techniques that require absolutley ZERO investment.
