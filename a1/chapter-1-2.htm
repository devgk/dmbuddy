<h2>Understanding Digital Marketing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marketing is an essential part of any business. In this topic, you will understand the fundamentals of traditional marketing and digital marketing.</p>

<h3>Understand marketing</h3>
<p class="definition" style="background-color: #5e384b; color: #ffffff;">Marketing is the science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above definition is self-explanatory. Now, let's elaborate marketing into three basic components.</p>

<h4>Components of marketing</h4>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Generating Awareness:</b> Here I am talking about the consumer awareness. Business owners increase consumer awareness by employing a wide range of marketing techniques. The main reason of creating consumer awareness is to <span style="background-color: #f9e6a5;">make consumers aware of a particular products or services</span>. It’s basically a passive marketing technique, where business and companies teaches consumers – how they can use a particular product or services. Companies which produces high-quality products and provides top-notch customer service must create public awareness of these values through commercials, billboards or digital marketing campaigns.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Creating Need:</b> If your audiences are already aware of a particular product or services. Then the next step will be <span style="background-color: #f9e6a5;">creating the need for that particular product or services in the customer's mind</span>. If someone doesn't need that particular product or services, he or she won’t buy it. Don’t get confused with want. Wants are a step ahead of needs and are largely dependent on the needs of customers themselves. The customer wants particular products and services only when they are aware of particular product and services and they really need it. Creating wants is a complex procedure and depends upon the many factors. Many times it’s not in the controls of even the most expert marketing professionals.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Satisfying the Demand:</b> Generating awareness and creating need, are the essential parts of any marketing campaign. But it’s just not enough. In order to sustain the business and make profit. You actually need to sell your product or services by satisfying the demand. <span style="background-color: #f9e6a5;">It means identifying the potential customer (consumers who want a particular product or services) and fulfilling their demand at a profit</span>. Big brands, companies, and business often release multiple types of discounts, offers, sales etc. Just to satisfy the demands of their customer before their competitors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Traditional Marketing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional marketing refers to any type of promotion, advertising or campaign that has been in use by companies for years, which has a proven success rate and that does not involve the use of internet. Methods of traditional marketing can include print advertisements, such as newsletters, billboards, flyers, newspaper print ads etc.</p>
<p class="note" style="background-color: #5f9ea0; color: #ffffff;">As we are approaching towards the future, our marketing and promotion strategies are evolving over the time. We are now moving from old traditional marketing towards digital marketing. We are experimenting new ways to target and to reach, to our potential customers mind.</p>

 
<h3>Digital marketing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital marketing refers to any type of promotion, advertising or campaign that runs on a digital platform (such as a computer, laptop, tablet, smartphones, mobile etc.) through internet is digital marketing. We can also say, Digital marketing is the promotion of any company, business, product, services etc. on the worldwide network of the internet.</p>
<p class="definition" style="background-color: #5e384b; color: #fff;">Digital marketing is a wide term used for the targetable, measurable, and interactive marketing process of products or services using digital technologies over a global network of internet in order to reach, to the widest majority of the audiences.</p>
<p class="note" style="background-color: #5f9ea0; color: #ffffff;">Digital marketing is known by many names, such as Internet Marketing, Online Marketing, Digital Promotion, Internet Promotion, Online Promotion etc. Further, you will learn more technical terms along with this course. You can use DM Reference anytime to learn more about the new terms.</p>

 
<h4>How digital marketing is different than traditional marketing?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital Marketing and traditional marketing are both an absolute form of marketing. <span style="background-color: #f9e6a5;">The difference between traditional and digital marketing lies in their strategies, process, and platform</span>. Both can be combined effectively for exceptional results.</p>

    It was informative!

    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Yeah!
    </span></p>

    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/stuart.png"/><nm>

    Bob can we combine traditional marketing with digital marketing?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Yes! I think so. Kevin can you please explain!
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Yes of course! We can use traditional marketing and digital marketing at the same time. Bob is right. And it’s always a good idea to use both at the same time. It allows a business to reach to its potential customers from every possible medium.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/stuart.png"/><nm>
    stuart
    </nm><span>
    So it is compulsory for a business to do both digital marketing and traditional marketing together.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Nothing is compulsory, it’s just recommended. You should choose according to your business model and investment capacity. As I think you already know how costly traditional marketing is. It requires big investments when it comes to putting your ads on newspaper, television etc. Most of the small businesses and startups, just can’t afford it.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/stuart.png"/><nm>
    stuart
    </nm><span>
    Oh, I see. Bob, I think Kevin wants to say digital marketing is cheaper. What do you think bob?
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/bob.png"/><nm>
    Bob
    </nm><span>
    Of course Stuart. Kevin, please explain him.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><img draggable="false" src="../images/kevin.png"/><nm>
    Kevin
    </nm><span>
    Comparatively Bob is right. Digital marketing is cheaper than traditional marketing. We will learn this in next topic. Just remember that there are few digital marketing techniques that require absolutley ZERO investment.
